			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>Painting, the expression of ideas and emotions, with the creation of certain aesthetic qualities, in a two-dimensional visual language. The elements of this language—its shapes, lines, colours, tones, and textures—are used in various ways to produce sensations of volume, space, movement, and light on a flat surface. These elements are combined into expressive patterns in order to represent real or supernatural phenomena, to interpret a narrative theme, or to create wholly abstract visual relationships. An artist’s decision to use a particular medium, such as tempera, fresco, oil, acrylic, watercolour or other water-based paints, ink, gouache, encaustic, or casein, as well as the choice of a particular form, such as mural, easel, panel, miniature, manuscript illumination, scroll, screen or fan, panorama, or any of a variety of modern forms, is based on the sensuous qualities and the expressive possibilities and limitations of those options. The choices of the medium and the form, as well as the artist’s own technique, combine to realize a unique visual image.

		<section class="main-seciton" id="Types_of_painting">
			<h1>Types of painting</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>Modernism </li>
				<p>- modern art includes artistic work produced during the period extending roughly from the 1860s to the 1970s, and denotes the styles and philosophies of the art produced during that era.</p>
				<li>Impressionism </li>
				<p>- impressionism describes a style of painting developed in France during the mid-to-late 19th century; characterizations of the style include small, visible brushstrokes that offer the bare impression of form, unblended color and an emphasis on the accurate depiction of natural light.</p>
				<li>Abstract Art</li>
				<p> - abstract art uses visual language of shape, form, color and line to create a composition which may exist with a degree of independence from visual references in the world.</p>
				<li>Expressionism </li>
				<p>	- expressionism, artistic style in which the artist seeks to depict not objective reality but rather the subjective emotions and responses that objects and events arouse within a person.</p>
				<li>Cubism </li>
				<p>- a style of painting and sculpture developed in the early 20th century, characterized chiefly by an emphasis on formal structure, the reduction of natural forms to their geometrical equivalents, and the organization of the planes of a represented object independently of representational requirements.</p>
				<li>Surrealism </li>
				<p>		- the principles, ideals, or practice of producing fantastic or incongruous imagery or effects in art, literature, film, or theater by means of unnatural or irrational juxtapositions and combinations. Other Words from surrealism Example Sentences Learn More about surrealism.</p>

			<h1>5 basic fundamentals of art</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>Line</li>
				<p>- line is the most essential of all art elements somehow comes naturally. The line is particularly important for one other reason as well, and it is its potential to convey the personal touch of an artist.</p>
				<li>Shape</li>
				<p>- shapes are defined as two-dimensional figures that we can discern as familiar. These include geometric shapes (deployed by cubists, for example), organic (which you may find among the examples of Art Nouveau posters and paintings), abstract, etc. Form, on the other hand, is a three-dimensional figure, meaning that it occupies a certain amount of space.</p>
				<li>Color</li>
				<p>- color is the light reflected off objects, perceived in different hues depending on the wavelength. Also colors are able to induce the widest range of emotions out all the visual art elements, which is why they are often seen as enigmatic and cryptic as if they truly possess a power to affect our emotional state.</p>
				<li>Texture</li>
				<p>- texture is the quality of a surface, which is a sensation perceivable by the skin rather than the eyes. However, we have been able to build a knowledge of how particularly looking surfaces and materials feel, thanks to their palpable qualities and our experience with them. </p>
				<li>Space</li>
				<p>- all art is placed within a certain space (aren’t we all, in the end). But when it comes to visual arts, there are several ways in which we tend to use the term space. Space is often illusively recreated in a painting or a drawing, realistically or in a distorted manner. </p>

				<section class="main-seciton" id="Deciding_Which_Paint_to_Use">
					<h1>Deciding Which Paint to Use</h1>
					<p>The first step is deciding what paint you are going to use. The four main choices are oils (traditional or water-soluble), watercolors, acrylics, and pastels. It is a very personal choice: If one type of paint doesn't suit you, be sure to try another. </p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Oil paint.</li>
						<p>Oil paint is a traditional artist's medium. It is pigment mixed with such oils as linseed, safflower, or poppy, and thinned with turpentine. It should be used on supports that have been primed with gesso to protect the surface—which can even include paper—from the acid in the oil. Oil paint is slow-drying, so the paint can stay wet on the palette and workable on the painting for many days, making it easy to blend. Cleanup requires solvents such as turpentine or mineral spirits. Water-soluble oils have been introduced in recent years, requiring only water to thin the paints and clean the brushes.</p>

						<li>Watercolor paint</li>
						<p>Watercolor paint is another traditional medium and uses pigment mixed with a binder made of gum arabic and additives to improve solubility and flow. It is water-soluble, transparent, and comes in a tube, pan, and liquid form. Watercolor paint can be reactivated with water when dry and reworked, even years after you finish your painting. The characteristics of watercolor—its convenience, portability, and easy cleanup—make it a very popular medium for both finished works as well as sketchbooks and visual journals.</p>

						<li>Acrylic paint</li>
						<p>Acrylic paint is a more modern choice—it only recently became commercially available for artists in the 1950s. In acrylic paints, the pigment is suspended in a plastic polymer. It's most notable for its quick drying time and can be used on almost any surface without priming. It's water-soluble, making cleanup much easier (all you'll need are soap and water). Acrylic dries into a durable, flexible, water-resistant surface. It is very versatile and can be used thinly like watercolors or more thickly like oil paints, depending on the desired effect. </p>

						<li>Pastel Paint</li>
						<p>As a budding pastel painter, you will likely develop your own preferred brands, but until then, a few stand out or at least are worth a try. John Hersey's handmade Unison pastels are perfect for beginners. With almost 400 different pastels—sold individually or as color-coordinated sets—you can add colors as you need them. Schmincke makes the most beautifully soft pastels available: With an almost buttery texture, they glide onto the surface of the paper, even over already heavily worked areas. Rembrandt soft pastels are excellent for line work and early layering in of color: These are probably the best pastels for starting a painting.</p>

						<li>Digital Paint</li>
						<p>As your using a software here most likely , you must learn the program for you to fully utilized its capabilities. Also identify what style do you want to do, so that you can use specific process and brushes for the wanted outcome of your artwork</p>

				<section class="main-seciton" id="Learning_to_Mix_Colors">
					<h1>Learning to Mix Colors</h1>
					<p>Beginners often shy away from color and color mixing (especially when it’s labeled "color theory"), but the basics of color mixing aren’t particularly complicated. Color and pigment provide so many different painting possibilities and nuances that an artist could spend a lifetime exploring color, color theory, and color mixing. Indeed, color mixing is something that often overwhelms beginners because it can be complicated, but color mixing can also be pared down to some fundamental tips.

					So, embrace the challenge, learn, and soon you'll be mixing just the right tints, tones, and shades. And, if you don’t want to waste the paint by throwing it away, use it with some white to do a monochrome painting or value exercise. Value is another term for tone, which refers to how light or dark the colors are. A value exercise, then, involves working to create lighter or darker tones in your painting.</p>

				<section class="main-seciton" id="The_Steps_in_Making_a_Painting">
					<h1>The Steps in Making a Painting</h1>
					<p>The steps in the creation of a painting vary from artist to artist and develop over time. Many artists lightly sketch out the composition on a canvas, then block in the main areas of color across the canvas. You can start with the larger shapes and work toward the smaller ones, gradually working on the detail. Some artists work in layers and others work alla prima (all at once) to complete their painting in a single session. Artists often do studies (small versions) or multiple sketches for a painting. There is no right or wrong approach; ultimately you must find what works best for you. </p>
					<section class="main-seciton" id="Finding_Ideas_for_Paintings">
						<h1>Finding Ideas for Paintings</h1>
						<p>Some days you will have more ideas than you can get down; others you may find yourself hunting around for inspiration. This is why a creativity journal can be very useful. And don't despair if you make a "mistake" in your painting: Those can be what artists call "happy accidents," resulting in something beautiful. If you're still struggling to come up with concepts, take an enjoyable hour or two to scan the top books for painting ideas and inspiration. </p>
						<section class="main-seciton" id="Safety Tips"></section>
						<h1>Safety Tips</h1>
						<p>The No. 1 rule regarding safety and art materials should be obvious—sloppy work habits can be dangerous. Avoid eating a sandwich with paint on your hands, for example. Know what you’re using and what precautions you need or want to take, and where to find nontoxic art materials.</p>
